Given Problem: 
Given an array arr[] of size N and an integer K. Find the maximum for each and every contiguous subarray of size K.
N = 9, K = 3
arr[] = 1 2 3 1 4 5 2 3 6
Output: 
3 3 4 5 5 5 6 

Brute Force Solution: 
This can be done by finding all the possible subarrays using 2 for loops in O(N2).

Optimal Solution using Sliding Window: 
Consider a window of size k and you just need to slide the window across the array. 
That is once the maximum is found in first k elements, remove the first element from the window and add the (k+1)th element in window.
And then again calculate the maximum using the previous data.

Identification of Sliding Window problems:
- Given an array/string
- subarray/substring
- find maximum/minimum
- k = window size

Types of Sliding Windows:
- Fixed size window -> do some calculations with the fixed size of window and find max/min
- Variable size window -> largest/smallest window subjected to a condition
