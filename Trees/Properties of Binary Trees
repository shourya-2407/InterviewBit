1. The maximum number of nodes at level ‘l’ of a binary tree is 2l
2. The Maximum number of nodes in a binary tree of height ‘h’ is 2h – 1
3. In a Binary Tree with N nodes, the minimum possible height or the minimum number of levels is Log2(N+1)
4. A Binary Tree with L leaves has at least | Log2L |+ 1   levels
5. In a Binary tree where every node has 0 or 2 children, the number of leaf nodes is always one more than nodes with two children
6. In a non-empty binary tree, if n is the total number of nodes and e is the total number of edges, then e = n-1
