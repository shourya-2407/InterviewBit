What is the time complexity of the following code :

        int j = 0;
        for(int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            while(j < n && arr[i] < arr[j]) {
                j++;
            }
        }

Solution:
// The outer loop for sure runs for N times --> O(N)
// The inner loop runs for N times irrespective of i, because it is initialised outside of the first loop
// So the TC = O(N) + O(N) ==> O(N)
