A typical java application has 3 layers:
  a. Web Layer = controller 
  b. Business Layer = service
  c. Data Layer = dao 

AOP -> Aspect-Oriented Programming. where all the cross cutting concerns are grouped together.
       These aspects are commonly used by many classes.

Plain Old Java Object (POJO) -> not with any restriction

Java Beans => POJO with some restrictions.  
              1. They should implement serializable
              2. Fields should be private
              3. Getter setter and a no-arg consrtuctor should be present, fields should be accessed through these only.

Dependency injection (DI)
=> When class one uses objects of other classes.
