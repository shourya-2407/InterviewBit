A Graph is a non-linear data structure consisting of vertices and edges.
The graph is denoted by G(V, E).

* Minimum Spanning Tree
A graph which has N nodes, N-1 edges and all nodes are reachable from each other.

* Bipartite Graph
If you can color the graph with 2 colors, such that no 2 adjacent nodes have the same color

*Types of Graph:

1. Null Graph
A graph is known as a null graph if there are no edges in the graph.

2. Trivial Graph
Graph having only a single vertex, it is also the smallest graph possible.

3. Undirected Graph
A graph in which edges do not have any direction. That is the nodes are unordered pairs in the definition of every edge. 

4. Directed Graph
A graph in which edge has direction. That is the nodes are ordered pairs in the definition of every edge.

5. Connected Graph
The graph in which from one node we can visit any other node in the graph is known as a connected graph. 

6. Disconnected Graph
The graph in which at least one node is not reachable from a node is known as a disconnected graph.

7. Regular Graph
The graph in which the degree of every vertex is equal to K is called K regular graph.

8. Complete Graph
The graph in which from each node there is an edge to each other node.

9. Cycle Graph
The graph in which the graph is a cycle in itself, the degree of each vertex is 2. 

10. Cyclic Graph
A graph containing at least one cycle is known as a Cyclic graph.

11. Directed Acyclic Graph
A Directed Graph that does not contain any cycle. 

12. Bipartite Graph
A graph in which vertex can be divided into two sets such that vertex in each set does not contain any edge between them.

13. Weighted Graph
A graph in which the edges are already specified with suitable weight is known as a weighted graph.
