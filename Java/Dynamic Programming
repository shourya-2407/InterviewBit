* How to identify DP?
-> a. Choice -> overlapping recursion
   b. Optimal

* Properties of Dynammic programming strategy
1. Overlapping subproblems -> sub problems repeated
2. Optimal substructure -> an optimal solution to a problem contains optimal solutions to subproblems

There are 2 approaches for solving DP problems:
Top down => memoization
Bottom up => tabulation
