Properties:
1. The maximum number of nodes at level ‘l’ of a binary tree is 2l
2. The Maximum number of nodes in a binary tree of height ‘h’ is 2h – 1
3. In a Binary Tree with N nodes, the minimum possible height or the minimum number of levels is Log2(N+1)
4. A Binary Tree with L leaves has at least | Log2L |+ 1   levels
5. In a Binary tree where every node has 0 or 2 children, the number of leaf nodes is always one more than nodes with two children
6. In a non-empty binary tree, if n is the total number of nodes and e is the total number of edges, then e = n-1

Types of Binary Trees: 
A.Based on number of children
1. Full Binary Tree -  A Binary Tree is a full binary tree if every node has 0 or 2 children.
2. Degenerate (or pathological) tree - A Tree where every internal node has one child. Such trees are performance-wise same as linked list.
3. Skewed Binary Tree - A skewed binary tree is a pathological/degenerate tree in which the tree is either dominated by the left nodes or the right nodes. 
Thus, there are two types of skewed binary tree: left-skewed binary tree and right-skewed binary tree.

B. Based on completion of levels
1. Complete Binary Tree - A Binary Tree is a Complete Binary Tree if all the levels are completely filled except possibly the last level 
and the last level has all keys as left as possible.
2. Perfect Binary Tree - A Binary tree is a Perfect Binary Tree in which all the internal nodes have two children and 
all leaf nodes are at the same level. 
3. Balanced Binary Tree - A binary tree is balanced if the height of the tree is O(Log n) where n is the number of nodes.
