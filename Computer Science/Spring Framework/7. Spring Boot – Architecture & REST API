* Architecture:
- follows a layered architecture.
- The main aim is to remove the XML and annotations-based configuration settings from the application.

Consists of the following four layers:
Presentation Layer – Authentication & Json Translation
Business Layer – Business Logic, Validation & Authorization
Persistence Layer – Storage Logic, responsible for converting business objects to the database row and vice-versa.
Database Layer – Actual Database

Spring Boot flow architecture: 

1. The Client makes an HTTP request(GET, PUT, POST, etc.)
2. The HTTP request is forwarded to the Controller. The controller maps the request. 
   It processes the handles and calls the server logic.
3. The business logic is performed in the Service layer. 
   The spring boot performs all the logic over the data of the database which is mapped to the spring boot model class through Java Persistence Library(JPA).
4. The JSP page is returned as Response from the controller.
