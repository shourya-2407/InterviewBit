Disadvantage of spring projects is that configuration is really time-consuming and can be a bit overwhelming for the new developers.

* Features of Spring Boot:
- Spring Boot is an open-source Java framework used to create a Micro Service.
- Spring Boot, a module of the Spring framework.
- facilitates Rapid Application Development (RAD) capabilities.
- Spring Boot is built on the top of the spring and contains all the features of spring.
- It allows to avoid heavy configuration of XML which is present in spring.
  Unlike the Spring MVC Project, in spring boot everything is auto-configured.
  For eg: If we want to use hibernate(ORM) then we can just add @Table annotation and @Column.
- It provides easy maintenance and creation of REST end points.
- It includes embedded Tomcat-server.
- Deployment is very easy, war and jar file can be easily deployed in the tomcat server.

* Spring Boot Annotations:
@SpringBootApplication: This annotation is used to mark the main class of a Spring Boot application. 
It encapsulates @SpringBootConfiguration, @EnableAutoConfiguration, and @ComponentScan annotations with their default attributes.

@SpringBootConfiguration: Class-level annotation. It implies that a class provides Spring Boot application configuration.
Most Spring Boot Applications use @SpringBootConfiguration via @SpringBootApplication.

@EnableAutoConfiguration: This annotation auto-configures the beans that are present in the classpath

@ComponentScan: tells Spring in which packages you have annotated classes that should be managed by Spring.

@Controller: This annotation provides Spring MVC features. 
It is used to create Controller classes and simultaneously it handles the HTTP requests.

@RestController: This annotation is used to handle REST APIs such as GET, PUT, POST, DELETE etc. 
and also used to create RESTful web services using Spring MVC.

@RequestMapping: @RequestMapping(value=" ",method=RequestMapping.GET)

@RequestParam: This annotation is basically used to obtain a parameter from URI.
  @GetMapping("/authors") 
  public String getAuthors(@RequestParam(name="authorName") String name){...} 

@PathVariable: This annotation is used to extract the data from the URI path.
  @GetMapping("/author/{authorName}") 
  public String getAuthorName(@PathVariable(name = "authorName") String name){...}

@RequestBody: used to convert HTTP requests from incoming JSON format to domain objects directly from request body.

@ResponseBody:  used to convert the domain object into HTTP request in the form of JSON or any other text

@ModelAttribute: refers to model object in Spring MVC. It can be used on methods or method arguments as well.
  @ModelAttribute("author")
  public Author author(){...}
