1. What is Object Oriented Programming (OOP)?"
- A computer programming model that organizes software design around data, or objects, rather than functions and logic.
- An object can be defined as a data field that has unique attributes and behavior.
- Benefits of OOP include code reusability, scalability and efficiency.

Structure of OOP:
1. classes: user-defined data types that act as the blueprint for individual object.
2. objects: are instances of a class created with specifically defined data. 
3. methods: are functions that objects can perform.
4. attributes: represent the state of an object.

Main principles of OOPs:
1. Encapsulation: principle states that all imp info is contained inside an object and only select info is exposed.
2. Abstration: hiding any unnecessary implementation code, reveal internal mechanisms that are relevant for the use of other objects.
3. Inheritance: Classes can reuse code and properties from other classes. 
4. Polymorphism: Objects are designed to share behaviors, and they can take on more than one form.

Benefits of OOPs: modularity, reusability, interface description, security, Easily upgradable and scalable.
