1. What is the purpose of SQL?
SQL = Structured Query Language
interacts with the relational databases in the form of inserting, deleting and updating/modifying the data in the database.

2. What is RDBMS? 
-> is a program used to create, update, and manage relational databases.

3. What is the use of the DROP command and what are the differences between DROP, TRUNCATE and DELETE commands?
* DROP (DDL) =  deletes permanently the entire table structure, database, index, or view, all the privileges/indexes related to it gets deleted, cannot be rolled back.
* TRUNCATE (DDL) = deletes data from table, the structure still remains, cannot be rolled back in some databases, maintains no log.
* DELETE (DML) = delete specific rows from table, can be rolled back, maintains logs hence a bit slow.
Eg:
DELETE from table_name WHERE col_id == 1; // deletes specific rows
DELETE from table_name; // will delete all data, row by row
TRUNCATE table_name; // deletes all data
DROP TABLE table_name; // deletes entire table

4. What is a functional dependency in the DBMS?
-> Describes the relationship between attributes (columns) in a table.
a. Trivial functional dependency => X → Y and Y is the subset of X, Eg:{roll_no, name} → name
b. Non-Trivial functional dependency =>  X → Y and Y is not a subset of X, Eg:{roll_no, name} → age
c. Multivalued functional dependency => a → {b, c} and no functional dependency between b and c. Eg: roll_no → {name, age}
d. Transitive functional dependency => a → b & b → c, implies, a → c
 
5. What is Static and dynamic SQL?  

6. What is the difference between CHAR and VARCHAR?

7. Why we cannot use WHERE clause with aggregate functions like HAVING ? 
The difference between the having and where clause in SQL is that the where clause canNOT be used with aggregates, but the having clause can.

8. Difference between primary key and unique key and why one should use a unique key if it allows only one null ? 

9. What is a join in the SQL? What are the different types of joins in SQL?
used to combine data from two or more tables, based on a common field between them.
Eg: EnrollNo is the common column
SELECT StudentCourse.CourseID, Student.StudentName
       FROM StudentCourse
       INNER JOIN Student 
       ON StudentCourse.EnrollNo = Student.EnrollNo
       ORDER BY StudentCourse.CourseID;

10. Explain the Stored Procedure.

11. What is conceptual design in dbms?

12. Differentiate between logical database design and physical database design. Show how this separation leads to data independence.

13. What are temporary tables? When are they useful?

14. Explain different types of failures that occur in the Oracle database.

15. What is the main difference between UNION and UNION ALL?
* UNION -> combines result-set of 2 or more SELECT statements.
           UNION selects only distinct values.
           the SELECT statements must have equal number of columns of same data type in order.
* UNION ALL -> select duplicate values!
Eg:
SELECT City, Country FROM Customers
WHERE Country='Germany'
UNION (or UNION ALL)
SELECT City, Country FROM Suppliers
WHERE Country='Germany'
ORDER BY City;

16. What is the concept of sub-query/inner query/nested query in terms of SQL?
Sub-query is basically the query that is included inside some other query.

17. What is Correlated Subquery in DBMS?
-> Subquery is executed for each of the rows of the outer query (Just like nested FOR loop)
Eg: SELECT * from EMP WHERE ‘RIYA’ IN (SELECT Name from DEPT WHERE EMP.EMPID=DEPT.EMPID);

18. What’s the difference between materialized and dynamic view? 

19. Write a trigger to update Emp table such that, If an updation is done in Dep table then salary of all employees of that 
department should be incremented by some amount (updation) Assuming Table name are Dept and Emp, trigger can be written as follows

20. There is a table which contains two columns Student and Marks, you need to find all the students, 
whose marks are greater than average marks i.e. list of above-average students.

21. Name the Employee who has the third-highest salary using sub queries.

22. How can you get the alternate records from the table in the SQL?

23. How is the pattern matching done in the SQL?

24. There is a table where only one row is fully repeated. Write a Query to find the Repeated row.

25. Query to find 2nd highest salary of an employee?

26. Consider the following Employee table. How many rows are there in the result of the following query? 
How many rows are there in the result of the following query?
