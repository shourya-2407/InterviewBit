1. Issues with traditional file based system:
- absence of indexing, super slow, redundancy, inconsistency, unorganised data.

2. Advantages of DBMS:
- Data sharing, integrity(accuracy, consistency) constraints ensures organised and refined data, controlling redundancy, 
  provides backup and recovery failure, data security(authentication and encryption).

3. Different languages of DBMS:
a. Data Definition Language (DDL): commands that define DB. E.g., CREATE, ALTER, DROP, TRUNCATE, RENAME, etc. 
b. Data Modification Language (DML): manipulate the data present in the database. E.g., SELECT, UPDATE, INSERT, DELETE, etc.
c. Data Control Languag (DCL): deal with the user permissions and controls of the DB. E.g., GRANT and REVOKE.
d. Transaction Control Language (TCL): deal with the transaction of the database. E.g., COMMIT, ROLLBACK, and SAVEPOINT.
